# IoT-based-RFID-attendance-system
Developed an IoT-based attendance system using RFID tags, an RFID sensor, and ESP8266. It reads RFID tags to identify users, marking attendance in an Excel sheet with pre-registered names and numbers. Users receive a confirmation message about their status, ensuring seamless, automated attendance tracking and efficient data management.
